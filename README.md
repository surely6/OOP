# 🧠 APU Psychology Consultation Management System  
### A Java-Based Desktop Scheduling & Request Management App

---

## 📘 Introduction

This Java Swing application is a **Consultation Management System** developed for managing psychology consultations at APU. It features a user-friendly interface for lecturers and students to log in, register, book consultation time slots, and manage session statuses like Approved, Rejected, or Completed. Built entirely in Java, the system handles dynamic content generation, room allocation, calendar logic, and file-based data persistence—making it an ideal project for showcasing object-oriented programming (OOP), UI development, and real-world logic implementation.

## 🧰 Installation & Run Instructions (for Java IDEs like NetBeans)

1. Open Apache NetBeans and create a new Java project.
2. Navigate to the project where you can see src folder and delete the auto generated file in src folder.
   e.g. C:\Users\Lenovo\Documents\NetBeansProjects\JavaApplication8
3. Download the src file on this github OOP repository to the project file you created. 
4. Make sure there is only one src folder in the project.
5. Navigate to Startv3.java, click source tap on top right, right-click on the code and Run file.
6. Start registering/logging in and explore the available time slot booking features!

## ⚠️ Known Limitations
⏱ Time Sync Issue:
There is a slight time mismatch between the system's slot display and real-world current time when viewed in some environments (especially SL site references). This is under investigation and will be addressed in future versions.

## 📌 Technologies Used
- Java (JDK 17+)
- Java Swing (GUI)
- File Handling (FileWriter, Scanner, BuferedReader)
- OOP Principles: Inheritance, Encapsulation, Polymorphism
- NetBeans as IDEs
